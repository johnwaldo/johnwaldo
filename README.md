## Work with AI

| Metric | 24h | 7 Days | 28 Days | 365 Days |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Screen time (Mac) | 0h | 0h | 0h | ~0h* |
| User AI session hours | 0.0h | 5.9h | 18.2h | 18.2h |
| AI worker hours | 1.3h | 9.6h | 43.5h | 43.5h |
| AI concurrency hours | 1.3h | 17.9h | 71.1h | 71.1h |
| Interactive sessions | 0 | 10 | 34 | 34 |
| Worker sessions | 22 | 154 | 478 | 478 |

_Screen time from macOS display events, snapshotted daily. *365-day extrapolated (accumulating real data)._

_User AI session hours measured from AI message timestamps (reading, thinking, typing between responses)._

## AI Model Usage (last 30 days)

_2,862.1M total tokens processed. 93.5% cache hit rate._

_$23,618.91 total saved ($20,847.49 caching + $2,771.42 model routing vs all-Opus)._

_Model savings are modest because ~93.5% of tokens are cache reads, where price differences between models are small._
