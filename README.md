## Work with AI

| Metric | 24h | 7 Days | 28 Days | 365 Days |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Screen time (Mac) | 0h | 0h | 0h | ~0h* |
| User AI session hours | 1.0h | 6.2h | 13.4h | 13.4h |
| AI worker hours | 1.3h | 8.9h | 18.3h | 18.3h |
| AI concurrency hours | 2.6h | 17.0h | 38.4h | 38.4h |
| Interactive sessions | 2 | 7 | 22 | 22 |
| Worker sessions | 21 | 149 | 300 | 300 |

_Screen time from macOS display events, snapshotted daily. *365-day extrapolated (accumulating real data)._

_User AI session hours measured from AI message timestamps (reading, thinking, typing between responses)._

## AI Model Usage (last 30 days)

_2,195.1M total tokens processed. 93.2% cache hit rate._

_$15,872.66 total saved ($13,162.21 caching + $2,710.44 model routing vs all-Opus)._

_Model savings are modest because ~93.2% of tokens are cache reads, where price differences between models are small._
