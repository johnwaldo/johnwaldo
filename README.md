## Work with AI

| Metric | 24h | 7 Days | 28 Days | 365 Days |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Screen time (Mac) | 0h | 0h | 0h | ~0h* |
| User AI session hours | 0.0h | 15.2h | 20.5h | 20.5h |
| AI worker hours | 0.7h | 9.0h | 17.9h | 17.9h |
| AI concurrency hours | 0.7h | 31.0h | 46.7h | 46.7h |
| Interactive sessions | 0 | 15 | 17 | 17 |
| Worker sessions | 2 | 125 | 274 | 274 |

_Screen time from macOS display events, snapshotted daily. *365-day extrapolated (accumulating real data)._

_User AI session hours measured from AI message timestamps (reading, thinking, typing between responses)._

## AI Model Usage (last 30 days)

_1,348.4M total tokens processed. 92.5% cache hit rate._

_$8,120.84 total saved ($5,771.32 caching + $2,349.52 model routing vs all-Opus)._

_Model savings are modest because ~92.5% of tokens are cache reads, where price differences between models are small._
