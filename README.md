## Work with AI

| Metric | 24h | 7 Days | 28 Days | 365 Days |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Screen time (Mac) | 0h | 0h | 0h | ~0h* |
| User AI session hours | 1.9h | 6.9h | 16.7h | 16.7h |
| AI worker hours | 1.2h | 9.3h | 18.0h | 18.0h |
| AI concurrency hours | 3.8h | 19.1h | 42.7h | 42.7h |
| Interactive sessions | 2 | 8 | 25 | 25 |
| Worker sessions | 21 | 150 | 301 | 301 |

_Screen time from macOS display events, snapshotted daily. *365-day extrapolated (accumulating real data)._

_User AI session hours measured from AI message timestamps (reading, thinking, typing between responses)._

## AI Model Usage (last 30 days)

_2,497.1M total tokens processed. 93.3% cache hit rate._

_$18,884.63 total saved ($16,051.78 caching + $2,832.85 model routing vs all-Opus)._

_Model savings are modest because ~93.3% of tokens are cache reads, where price differences between models are small._
