## Work with AI

| Metric | 24h | 7 Days | 28 Days | 365 Days |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Screen time (Mac) | 0h | 0h | 0h | ~0h* |
| User AI session hours | 3.3h | 10.2h | 14.8h | 14.8h |
| AI worker hours | 1.7h | 9.4h | 18.9h | 18.9h |
| AI concurrency hours | 6.0h | 24.4h | 40.7h | 40.7h |
| Interactive sessions | 4 | 11 | 17 | 17 |
| Worker sessions | 20 | 150 | 301 | 301 |

_Screen time from macOS display events, snapshotted daily. *365-day extrapolated (accumulating real data)._

_User AI session hours measured from AI message timestamps (reading, thinking, typing between responses)._

## AI Model Usage (last 30 days)

_1,662.2M total tokens processed. 92.9% cache hit rate._

_$11,444.56 total saved ($9,056.16 caching + $2,388.40 model routing vs all-Opus)._

_Model savings are modest because ~92.9% of tokens are cache reads, where price differences between models are small._
